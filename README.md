# About me #
I've been learning coding since I was 11 or so, I am currently in middle school (going to high school this summer), and I work on my projects in my free time. I'm currently working on a chess engine, you can visit the MaxAve/NerdChess repo to learn more. Last year I did a short, 2 week internship at a small company that develops drones that help with logistics, I wrote a small program which initiates a short test flight and reports back on whether all hardware is working. I am hoping to do a longer internship during the summer holidays in my school.
