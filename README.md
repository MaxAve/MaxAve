# About me #
- Learning programming since I was 10 or so.
- Currently a high school student (technically there is no such thing as "high school" where I live, but if I were to live in the US I would be considered a high school student).
- I primarily work on small personal projects in my free time, such as my new chess engine PACE and my image editor PXArt (at the time of writing, PXArt is not on GitHub just yet, but it should come out soon).
- My primary programming languages are Java, C/C++, and Python. I also know a little JavaScript and C#.
- My most outstanding achievement is making a "Hello World" program in Assembly.
- My hobbies are playing chess, programming, and sleeping.
