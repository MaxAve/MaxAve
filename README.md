# About me #
I have been interested in coding for a large part of my life,\
I currently know the C++, Python, Java and C# Programming languages,\
I also have learned HTML/CSS/JavaScript some time ago, but I decided\
to drop that and learn something different. I know basics of game development\
with Unity, and currently I am interested in Robotics with ```ROS```.
