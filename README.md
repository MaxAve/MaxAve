# About me #
- Studying computer science and programming
- At the moment I primarily work on smaller personal projects like my chess engine (you can check it out at ```MaxAve/PACE```) and my autonomous navigation ROS package similar to navigation2 that I'm building from scratch (repo private atm)
- I use vim btw
